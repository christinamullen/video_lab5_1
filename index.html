        <h2>Jefferson Airplane - White Rabbit (1967) </h2>
        <p>One pill makes you larger
            And one pill makes you small
            And the ones that mother gives you
            Don't do anything at all
            Go ask Alice
            When she's ten feet tall</p>
        <p>And if you go chasing rabbits
            And you know you're going to fall
            Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar
            Has given you the call
            Call Alice
            When she was just small</p>
        <p>When the men on the chessboard
            Get up and tell you where to go
            And you've just had some kind of mushroom
            And your mind is moving low
            Go ask Alice
            I think she'll know</p>
        <p>When logic and proportion
            Have fallen sloppy dead
            And the White Knight is talking backwards
            And the Red Queen's off with her head
            Remember what the dormouse said
            Feed your head
            Feed your head</p>
